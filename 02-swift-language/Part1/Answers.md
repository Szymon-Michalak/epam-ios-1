### 1. Why does Swift introduce both `let` and `var`? When should you use each?

- `let` declares a **constant**: once set, the value cannot change.
- `var` declares a **variable**: its value can be changed after initialization.
- **Use `let` by default** for safety and immutability; only use `var` if mutation is required.

### 2. Is type annotation necessary in Swift? When is it helpful?

- **Not always necessary** due to type inference.
- Type annotation is helpful when:
  - Clarity is needed (especially with complex or ambiguous types)
  - The type should not change even if the initializer changes
  - Declaring function parameters and return types

Example:
```swift
let score: Int = 100 // Explicit
let name = "Alice"   // Inferred

3. What are the key differences between arrays, sets, and dictionaries?

Type	Ordered	Duplicates	Access Pattern
Array	‚úÖ Yes	‚úÖ Yes	Index-based (array[0])
Set	‚ùå No	‚ùå No	Fast membership test (contains)
Dictionary	‚ùå No	üîÅ Keys must be unique	Key-value access (dict["key"])

	‚Ä¢	Use array for ordered data, set for uniqueness, and dictionary for key-value pairs.

4. How does Swift handle string mutability? Difference between String and Character?
	‚Ä¢	String is a value type, mutable only when declared with var.
	‚Ä¢	Character represents a single Unicode scalar (like a letter or emoji).
	‚Ä¢	You build String values by combining Character values.

Example:

let char: Character = "A"
var greeting = "Hello"
greeting += " World" // Only possible because it's declared with `var`

5. What‚Äôs the difference between while and repeat-while? When use repeat-while?
	‚Ä¢	while evaluates the condition before entering the loop.
	‚Ä¢	repeat-while evaluates the condition after executing the loop body once.

Use repeat-while when you want the loop to run at least once, such as in input validation or prompting.

6. How does Swift support function overloading?

Swift allows multiple functions with the same name as long as their parameter types, labels, or return types differ.

Example:

func greet() {
    print("Hello")
}

func greet(name: String) {
    print("Hello, \(name)")
}

7. How does Swift handle captured values in closures? What happens if a closure strongly captures self?
	‚Ä¢	Swift captures values by reference or value, depending on the context.
	‚Ä¢	If a closure strongly captures self, it can lead to retain cycles in reference types (like classes).
	‚Ä¢	To avoid this, use a capture list:

[weak self] or [unowned self]



Example:

myClosure = { [weak self] in
    self?.doSomething()
}

8. What‚Äôs the difference between raw values and associated values in enums?
	‚Ä¢	Raw values are predefined values (like Int, String) assigned to enum cases.
	‚Ä¢	Associated values allow enum cases to store additional custom data.

Use associated values when enum cases carry context-specific data.

Example:

enum Result {
    case success(data: String)
    case failure(error: Error)
}

This is more powerful than:

enum StatusCode: Int {
    case success = 200
    case failure = 500
}

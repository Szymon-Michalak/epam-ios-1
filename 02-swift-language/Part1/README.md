# Swift Basics ‚Äì Part 1

This module provides a comprehensive introduction to the core concepts of the Swift programming language. It emphasizes Swift‚Äôs type-safe system and the importance of value types in building predictable, robust applications.

---

## üß† Overview

You‚Äôll start by exploring constants and variables, then move into arithmetic and logical operations. From there, you‚Äôll learn how to work with strings and characters, and how to store and manipulate data using arrays, dictionaries, and sets.

You‚Äôll also dive into control flow (conditionals and loops), write reusable functions, explore closures, and define custom data models using enumerations.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this part, you should be able to:

- [x] Understand Swift‚Äôs foundational building blocks, including value types and type safety
- [x] Perform arithmetic and logical operations
- [x] Work with strings and characters using Swift‚Äôs built-in features
- [x] Store and manage collections with arrays, dictionaries, and sets
- [x] Use control flow constructs like `if`, `for`, `while`, and `switch`
- [x] Write modular code using functions with parameters and return values
- [x] Create and use closures to write more flexible, concise code
- [x] Model custom data types with enumerations, including raw and associated values

## ‚ùì Questions for Self-Control

- Why does Swift introduce both `let` (constants) and `var` (variables)? When should you use each?
- Is type annotation necessary in Swift? When is it helpful?
- What are the differences between arrays, sets, and dictionaries? When would you use each?
- How does Swift handle string mutability? What‚Äôs the difference between `String` and `Character`?
- What‚Äôs the difference between a `while` loop and a `repeat-while` loop? Give a scenario where `repeat-while` is more appropriate.
- How does Swift support function overloading? Provide an example.
- How does Swift handle captured values in closures? What‚Äôs the impact of strongly capturing `self`?
- What‚Äôs the difference between raw values and associated values in enums? When is it better to use associated values?
